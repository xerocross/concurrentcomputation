# Concurrent Computation by Adam Cross

This is a learning project, a Spring Boot web
service that will perform various numerical 
computations using *concurrency*. This is a work
in progress started Sept 3, 2024.

The goal is to practice and demonstrate concurrency
in a web service that later I will wire up to
a React frontend.
